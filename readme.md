# 📰 Product PDR: AI-Powered Full-Stack PR Suite (MCP)

## 💡 Inspiration

Originally shared in [this LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7333001533128613910/), this project was born during my Digital PR course at **FLAME University, Pune**. I noticed how students and professionals alike were bogged down by repetitive, manual PR workflows.

That led to the concept of an AI-native **Media Communication Partner (MCP)**—a system designed to automate foundational PR work.

## 🌟 Our Goal

* Automate core PR tasks like sentiment audits, hook generation, and gap detection
* Accelerate learning with real-time, intelligent suggestions
* Build a unified, modular, and scalable PR productivity platform

This builds on previous reflections shared [here](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7313205339410026497/).
